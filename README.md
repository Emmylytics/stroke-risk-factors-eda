📊 Project Overview

This project explores a healthcare dataset to uncover key patterns and relationships between different patient attributes and the likelihood of experiencing a stroke.
The analysis focuses on understanding demographics, health status, and lifestyle factors using Python for data wrangling and visualization.

🧩 Objective

To perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis to identify potential stroke risk indicators and uncover meaningful insights that can inform future predictive work.

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook for analysis

Excel / CSV dataset as data source

🔍 Data Wrangling & EDA Steps

Handled missing and duplicate records

Cleaned inconsistent data types

Performed descriptive statistics and variable summaries

Visualized key features with bar charts, boxplots, and heatmaps

Examined age, glucose levels, BMI, and health conditions against stroke outcome

📈 Key Insights

Stroke occurrence was most frequent among older individuals (60+)

Hypertension and heart disease showed strong correlations with stroke cases

Average glucose level was noticeably higher among stroke patients

Smoking status showed that individuals who formerly smoked had a noticeably higher rate of stroke occurrence compared to current or non-smokers.

BMI showed a moderate relationship, with slightly higher stroke prevalence among individuals in higher BMI ranges.
